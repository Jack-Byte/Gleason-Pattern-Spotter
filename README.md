# Gleason Pattern Spotter
The Gleason Pattern Spotter is a web application that takes a prostate cancer image, divides the image into a grid of several boxes, and then detects the Gleason Pattern for each box. 

<font size=3 color=red>!!! Please be aware, that the detections are from perfect and should not be trusted !!!</font> 

This application is the result of my approach to the [PANDA Challange](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment). Due to bugs in my code I wasn't able to submit the approach yet. This application is designed to inspect the image, the boxes and the detected patterns.

Clicking the button below, will startup a server and run the application. After this is done you can test out the Simpson Classifier. *This can take up to five minutes!*
